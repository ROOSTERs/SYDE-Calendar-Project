# SYDE-Calendar-Project-

This project is being created to help the SYDE 2023 class manage their 1A schedule. This will list the homework assigned and their due dates as well as tests, exams and readings.

Designed by the BB.

This project will be a centralized spot for all things SYDE 2023 related. Instead of having various pieces of information posted on Facebook, calendars, etc, this project aims to be a one stop spot for staying organized.
